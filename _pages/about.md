    <h1 class="post-title"> ‚óå About ‚óå </h1>
    <p> An aggregation of the many things i love, am inspired by, and preoccupied with. In an age where we are all used to newsfeeds, I would like to move away from that, preferring instead to cultivate a space for slow tending. Sowing seeds, watering them, and letting them grow at their own time. Some seeds we sow and forget, only to find a lil green shoot peeking out from the earth months or years later. Some things may never see the light of day. </p>

  <p> This site is compiled by static site generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and hosted through <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. Ever since I discovered that one could easily view the page source of a website, I have been ceaseless in this business of every website that tickles my fancy - layout, color, font sizes. I have used that to patiently and gradually coax something of my own into existence. Much like how I would like to have the creative freedom to design and redesign my living space, I have been feeling like I want to do that for a space online as well. Many templates are created with a zero-friction checkout/cartout process with consumers and business transactions in mind and personally I believe these gestures stick. I am not an ecommerce site, so I don't really wish to look like one or have this space remind you of one. </p>
    
  <p> This site will always be a craft in progress, like how the work on a farm or garden never ends üßë‚Äçüåæ </p>
