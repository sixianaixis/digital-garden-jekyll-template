    <p> You see, I'm kind of a hoarder by nature. Here's sharing a collection of things/ideas/tools/goodies that i've amassed. Shapeshifts according to the flavour of the season and the way the wind blows. </p>

<p> There are some things that have piqued my interest and as much as i'd love to, i'm usually quite scattered, so i do not yet understand some of these things in depth. I cannot yet articulate where they converge, and if they diverge. They are, nevertheless, helluva interesting to me! Seeds. They're definitely seeds. </p>
