The idea of slow futures 

Slow cities - as a full cultural movement 

Slow web 
when increasing number of our digital interfaces are made to facilitate the scroll and the swipe, how can we cultivate gestures that are semblances of patience? What does creating a dwelling space online that stands in the flow of this speed need? 

Not everyone can afford to do slow, or soft
The softpower of japan, and occasionally china 
The slowness of scandinavian landscapes 
Hygge culture 
Backcountry-scapes. 

To endorse and lean towards these 
is to draw away from loud, chaotic, unpredictable. 

can we decouple our visual imageries of care, tenderness and affection from the slowness we think about?
When slowness and its accompanying images are made inaccessible to the masses, do we leave it at that?
